# Stanford
As an intern during the 2022 Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research Program (SIMR), I coded electronic functionality as part of our main prototype (an epinephrine administrating phone case). These arduino files include the code for the three automations I programmed using C++ on the Arduino IDE with the Adafruit Circuit Playground Classic (circular arduino). 

1. Automatically texting your first emergency contact
2. Automatically sensing temperature and texting your emergency contact when temperature is > 77ºF.
