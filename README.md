# Bioengineering at Stanford University
As an intern at the 2022 [Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research Program](https://simr.stanford.edu/), I coded electronic integration as part of our main medical device prototype, an epinephrine administrating phone case. These files include the code for the three automations I programmed using C++ on the Arduino IDE with the Adafruit Circuit Playground Classic microcontroller. Below is a video demo of one of these automations in action. More information can be found on the ["smartphone automation"](https://www.im-creator.com/free/teamsaturn/saturn#:~:text=view%20demo-,Smartphone%20Automation,-Electronic%20integration%20with) section of our project website.

1. Automatically texting your first emergency contact
2. Automatically sensing temperature and texting your emergency contact when temperature is > 77ºF.
3. Automatically opening our companion mobile app

## Microcontroller Demo #1
In this video, I demonstrate how the Adafruit Circuit Playground microcontoller unlocks your phone, messages the first contact in your emergency contact list with an emergency message, and sends your current location.

## Microcontroller Demo #2
In this video, I demonstrate how the Adafruit Circuit Playground microcontoller using temperature sensing and sends a text to your emergency contact whenever the temperature is > 77ºF.
