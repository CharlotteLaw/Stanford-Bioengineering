# Bioengineering at Stanford University
As an intern at the 2022 [Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research Program](https://simr.stanford.edu/), I coded electronic integration as part of our main medical device prototype, an epinephrine administrating phone case. These arduino files include the code for the three automations I programmed using C++ on the Arduino IDE with the Adafruit Circuit Playground Classic microcontroller. Below is a video demo of one of these automations in action.  

1. Automatically texting your first emergency contact
2. Automatically sensing temperature and texting your emergency contact when temperature is > 77ÂºF.
3. Automatically opening our companionan mobile app

In this video, I demonstrate how the Adafruit Circuit Playground microcontoller unlocks your phone, messages the first contact in your emergency contact list with an emergency message, and sends your current location.
